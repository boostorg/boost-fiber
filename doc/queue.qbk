[section:queues Queues]

__boost_fiber__ provides a bounded and a unbounded queue suitable to
synchonize fibers via message passing.

    typedef boost::fibers::unbounded_queue< int > queue_t;

    void send( queue_t & queue)
    {
        for ( int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
            queue.put( i);
        queue.deactivate();
    }

    void recv( queue_t & queue)
    {
        boost::optional< int > value;
        while ( queue.take( value) )
        { std::cout << "received " << * value << std::endl; }
    }

    queue_t queue;
    boost::fibers::fiber f1( boost::bind( send, ref( queue) ) );
    boost::fibers::fiber f2( boost::bind( recv, ref( queue) ) );

    f1.join();
    f2.join();

that no more values will arrive.]]

[variablelist
[[Effects:] [Dequeues a value from the queue. If no data is available from the
queue the fiber gets suspended until at least one new item is enqueued (return
value `true` and va contains dequeued value) or the queue gets deactivated and
the function returns `false`.]]

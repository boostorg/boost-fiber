[section:conditions Condition Variables]

[heading Synopsis]

        enum class cv_status; {
            no_timeout,
            timeout
        };

        class condition_variable;
        class condition_variable_any;

The class `condition_variable` provides a mechanism for a fiber to wait for
notification from another fiber. When the fiber awakens from the wait, then
it checks to see if the appropriate condition is now true, and continues if so.
If the condition is not true, then the fiber calls `wait` again to resume
waiting. In the simplest case, this condition is just a boolean variable:

    boost::fibers::condition_variable cond;
    boost::fibers::mutex mtx;
    bool data_ready = false;

    void process_data();

    void wait_for_data_to_process() {
        {
            std::unique_lock< boost::fibers::mutex > lk( mtx);
            while ( ! data_ready) {
                cond.wait( lk);
            }
        }   // release lk
        process_data();
    }

Notice that the `lk` is passed to `wait`: `wait` will atomically add the fiber
to the set of fibers waiting on the condition variable, and unlock the mutex.
When the fiber is awakened, the mutex will be locked again before the call to
`wait` returns. This allows other fibers to acquire the mutex in order to
update the shared data, and ensures that the data associated with the condition
is correctly synchronized.

In the meantime, another fiber sets `data_ready` to `true`, and then calls
either `notify_one` or `notify_all` on the condition variable `cond` to wake
one waiting fiber or all the waiting fibers respectively.

    void retrieve_data();
    void prepare_data();

    void prepare_data_for_processing() {
        retrieve_data();
        prepare_data();
        {
            std::unique_lock< boost::fibers::mutex > lk( mtx);
            data_ready = true;
        }
        cond.notify_one();
    }

Note that the same mutex is locked before the shared data is updated, but that
the mutex does not have to be locked across the call to `notify_one`.

Locking is important because the synchronization objects provided by
__boost_fiber__ can be used to synchronize fibers running on different
threads.

__boost_fiber__ provides both `condition_variable` and `condition_variable_any`.
`boost::fiber::condition_variable` can only wait on `std::unique_lock< boost::fibers::mutex >`
while `boost::fibers::condition_variable_any` can wait on user-defined lock types.

[#class_cv_status]
[heading Enumeration `cv_status`]

A timed wait operation might return because of timeout or not.

        enum class cv_status {
            no_timeout,

`condition_variable_any::wait()` call: the `condition_variable_any` itself, the
`mutex` coordinating access between fibers and a lock object (e.g.
`std::unique_lock`). In some sense it would be nice if the
`condition_variable_any`'s constructor could accept the related `mutex` object,
enforcing agreement across all `wait()` calls; but the existing APIs prevent
that. Instead we must require the `wait()` call to accept a reference to the
local lock object. It is an error to reuse a given `condition_variable_any`
instance with lock objects that reference ['different] underlying `mutex`
objects. It would be like a road intersection with traffic lights independent
of one another: sooner or later a collision will result.]]

[heading Tutorial]

Each __fiber__ represents a micro-thread which will be launched and managed
cooperatively by a scheduler. Objects of type __fiber__ are only moveable.

        boost::fibers::fiber f1; // not-a-fiber

        void f()
        {
            boost::fibers::fiber f2( some_fn);

            f1 = boost::move( f2); // f2 moved to f1
        }


[heading Launching]

[important Each thread must first set the fiber-scheduler before any __fiber__ construction.]

        boost::fibers::round_robin ds;
        boost::fibers::set_scheduling_algorithm( & ds);

        boost::fibers::fiber f1( some_fn);

[important Oliver: I think there should be a reference section on `algorithm`,
`round_robin` and `set_scheduling_algorithm`. It need not say much at this
point -- although since right now the only provided `algorithm` is
`round_robin`, it would be great if you would explain how to provide a custom
`algorithm`. I've added a note to the `fiber::priority()` method explaining
that `round_robin` disregards `priority()`.]

A new fiber is launched by passing an object of a callable type that can be
invoked with no parameters.
If the object must not (or cannot) be copied, then ['boost::ref] can be used to
pass in a reference to the function object. In this case, the user must ensure
that the referenced object outlives the newly-created fiber.

        struct callable
        { void operator()(); };

        boost::fibers::fiber copies_are_safe()
        {
            callable x;
            return boost::fibers::fiber( x);
        } // x is destroyed, but the newly-created fiber has a copy, so this is OK

        boost::fibers::fiber oops()
        {
            callable x;
            return boost::fibers::fiber( boost::ref( x) );
        } // x is destroyed, but the newly-created fiber still has a reference
          // this leads to undefined behaviour

Control is immediately transferred to the spawned __fiber__ at
construction. When the constructor returns, the __fiber__ might be complete or
might have suspended.


[heading Exceptions]

Exceptions thrown by the function or callable object passed to the __fiber__
constructor are consumed by the framework. If you need to know which
exception was thrown, use __future__ and __packaged_task__.


[heading Detaching]

A __fiber__ can be detached by explicitly invoking the __detach__ member
function. After __detach__ is called on a fiber object, that object represents
__not_a_fiber__. The fiber object may then safely be destroyed.

        boost::fibers::fiber( some_fn).detach();


[heading Joining]

In order to wait for a fiber to finish, the __join__ member function of the
__fiber__ object can be used. __join__ will block until the __fiber__ object
has completed.
If the __fiber__ has already completed, or the __fiber__ object represents
__not_a_fiber__, then __join__ returns immediately.

        void some_fn()
        { ... }

        boost::fibers::fiber f( some_fn);
        ...
        f.join();

If the fiber has already completed, then __join__ returns immediately and
the joined __fiber__ object becomes __not_a_fiber__.


[heading Destruction]

When a __fiber__ object representing a valid execution context is destroyed, the
program terminates if the fiber is __joinable__. If you intend the
fiber to outlive the __fiber__ object that launched it, use the __detach__
method.

        {
            boost::fibers::fiber f( some_fn);
        } // std::terminate() will be called

        {
            boost::fibers::fiber f(some_fn);
            f.detach();
        } // okay, program continues


[heading Interruption]

A valid fiber can be interrupted by invoking its __interrupt__ member function.
The next time that fiber executes one of the specific __interruption_points__ with
interruption enabled, a __fiber_interrupted__ exception will be thrown.
If this exception is not caught, the fiber will be terminated, its stack unwound,
its stack objects properly destroyed.

With __disable_interruption__ a fiber can avoid being interrupted.

        // interruption enabled at this point
        {
            boost::this_fiber::disable_interruption di1;
            // interruption disabled
            {
                boost::this::fiber::disable_interruption di2;
                // interruption still disabled
            } // di2 destroyed; interruption state restored
            // interruption still disabled
        } // di destroyed; interruption state restored
        // interruption enabled

At any point, the interruption state for the current thread can be queried by
calling __interruption_enabled__.
The following __interruption_points__ are defined and will throw
__fiber_interrupted__ if __interruption_requested__ and
__interruption_enabled__.

* __join__
* __barrier_wait__
* __cond_wait__
* __cond_wait_for__
* __cond_wait_until__
* __barrier_wait__
* __sleep_for__
* __sleep_until__
* __interruption_point__

[important Oliver: why isn't yield() an interruption point?]

[heading Fiber IDs]

Objects of class __fiber_id__ can be used to identify fibers. Each running
__fiber__ has a unique __fiber_id__ obtainable from the corresponding __fiber__
by calling the __get_id__ member function.
Objects of class __fiber_id__ can be copied, and used as keys in associative
containers: the full range of comparison operators is provided.
They can also be written to an output stream using the stream insertion
operator, though the output format is unspecified.

Each instance of __fiber_id__ either refers to some fiber, or __not_a_fiber__.
Instances that refer to __not_a_fiber__ compare equal to each other, but
not equal to any instances that refer to an actual fiber. The comparison
operators on __fiber_id__ yield a total order for every non-equal __fiber_id__.

        fg.add_fiber(&f);

But that doesn't seem very intuitive. I would rather see:

    boost::fibers::fiber_group fg;

        fg.add_fiber(f);
